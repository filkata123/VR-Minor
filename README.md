# vr-minor
The most important files from my time in the VR minor in Fontys ICT.

The Slicing folder contains my contribution to a joint university project that is currently on a secure gitlab instance. One day, I might recreate the project so that I can showcase how these shaders/scripts interact with each other. (The Dismember script is dependant on the ezy-slice fork in my git account)

The Blender folder contains blender projects.
